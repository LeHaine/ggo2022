## Theme: ClichÃ©

### Idea: Glutton for Punishment

A take on some sort of "being" (death? something else) to work (kill / fight something in hell? underworld? something
reddish and gorey)
by slaying mobs and collecting bones. The work starts out "easy" by handing a few mobs.
But as the hero continues slaying they may hit a threshold of some kind, either running out of health by being hit (or
something else)
and they are presented to the Bone Collector, (a tall handsome skeleton-y? being in a tux) that either rewards you (
really punishes)
you with more work, or sends you off and you lose.

### Style:

Top-down, with a reddish palette, pixel.

### Screens:

- Menu Screen
- The hero arena where the hero slays and collects bones.
- The bone man's office (think Hades game where Zagreus talks to Hades at his desk)
- Possible upgrades screen...

### Mechanics:

### Upgrades

- Possible upgrades from collecting bones when talking to the bone man.
    - Character abilities changes (stronger, aoe, etc)
    - Maybe something more roguelite-y and more passive upgrades like faster attacks, more HP, lower cooldowns, etc
    - Passive auto attacks (think vampire survivors)
	- Add abilities:
		- Dash: to dodge enemies and quickly get to enemies 
		- Soul drain: drain the soul of an enemy which instantly kills them
		- Banish: select & "banish" (kill) a bunch of enemies
		- Combo attacks on main attack
	

#### Hero

- Swing / Attack ability
- Dash / Dodge ability
- Something to do with bones ability

#### Mobs

- Range
- Melee
- ?

### Game Loop

Player starts the game -> meets in bone mans office (cut scene) and he gives speech / yells / demands -> game starts

Hero is in a smallish arena and mobs start appearing randomly around. Hero attacks mobs manually with the swing / dash
attacks. Mobs die and bones drop and hero must collect. Hero takes too much damage and "dies" and reappears in front
of the bone man in his office. Depending on the amount of mobs & mobs collected the hero is either banished or rewarded
with more work and can use bones to upgrade.

If rewarded with more work, hero goes back into small arena, stronger mobs appear, hero fights mobs with new upgrades,
hero dies, rinse and repeat.
