Add your aseprite files here in order to be exported by the `export_tags.sh` or `export_and_update.sh` scripts.

If you are making an animation, make sure you create tags for them all in order for them to export named correctly.

Example:

If you have a file called `hero.ase` or `hero.aseprite` and you have 3 tags in that file called `Idle`, `Run`, `Jump` they will be exported as:

`heroRun0, heroRun1, ...`, `heroIdle0, heroIdle1, ...`, and `heroJump0.png, heroJump1.png, ...`
